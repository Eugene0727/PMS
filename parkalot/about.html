						People face parking problems in most metropolitan area. Parkalot's aim is to make people find their parking space easily and assure no difficulties in parking. <b>"To park a lot is to secure a lot."</b> This project offers a web based reservation system
						where users can view various parking areas and select the space to view whether space is available or not. The difficulty roots from not knowing where the parking spaces are available at the given time, even if this is known; many vehicles may pursue a small number of parking spaces which in turn leads to serious traffic load. Users can even make payment online via credit card. After making payment users are notified about the booking via email along with unique parking number.
